  Date: Apr 12, 2020

  Abstract

	This  header  file  defines  the  trait  "my_destructor_T".   It  is  a  data
	structure, passed  as value, using the  common structs API, using  the struct
	descriptor API.   The purpose of  this trait is to  provide a unified  API to
	call the destructor of any resource.
